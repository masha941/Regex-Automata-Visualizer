# Regex-Automata-Visualizer

This project was inspired by a course at the Faculty of Mathematics that focuses on formal languages and automata theory with an introduction to translation.
I wanted to create a tool that would help visualize the regular expression a user inputs and also check if a string matches the regular expression in question. 
This project features a from-scratch implementation of NFA and DFA algorithms to demonstrate the core principles of automata theory.
