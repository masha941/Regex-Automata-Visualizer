# Regex-Automata-Visualizer

This project was inspired by the course on Faculty of Mathematics that focuses on formal languages and automata theory with an introduction to translation.
I wanted to create a tool that will help visualize regular expression that user inputs, and also check if a string matches regular expression in question.
This project contains implementation of NFA and DFA from scratch.
